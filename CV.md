### **Research and Work Experience:**

 * University of Arkansas Graduate Research Assistant | August 2019 - Present  
    - Utilizing culturomics techniques, including using an anaerobic chamber, as well as PCR and PCR purification for Sanger sequencing to culture and identify novel bacteria from the swine gut.  
    - Performing DNA extraction and library preparation, including PCR, gel electrophoresis, normalization, and quantification using Qubit, bioanalyzer, and qPCR for Illumina Miseq sequencing.  
    - Assisting with microbiome sampling in nursery swine.      
 * OSU Animal Genomics Lab, Undergraduate Research Assistant | January 2017 – August 2019  
    - Microbiologically characterized commensal bacteria found in healthy equine uteri through single colony purification, 16srRNA sequencing, and culturomics techniques.   
    - Completed real time and endpoint polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis in order to evaluate DNA expression and purity.   
    - Used NanoDrop microvolume spectrophotometer to measure DNA, RNA, and protein concentrations.   
 * Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab, Student Lab Technician | March 2017 – July 2019  
    - Analyzed bacteria colonies through plating and streaking techniques.   
    - Identified genus and species of bacteria colonies by using a MALDI-TOF Biotyper.   
    - Determined antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria colonies by using a Sensititre Complete Automated System.   
 * UT Southwestern Medical Center, Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow | June 2018 – August 2018  
    - Demonstrated CRISPR SAM success in gene overexpression using cells from murine small cell lung cancer.   
    - Utilized an Auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system to degrade EWS-FLI1 in Ewing Sarcoma cells.   
    - Knocked in a Tet-On 3G tetracycline-inducible expression system into the Ewing Sarcoma cell line, A673.   
 * Noble Research Institute, Lloyd Noble Scholar in Agriculture | May 2017 – August 2017  
    - Completed project that analyzed the phenotypic traits local cattle producers looked for when selecting their replacement herd.   
    - Assessed the heritability and economic values of these traits.   
    - Examined local producer acceptability of DNA testing.   
    - Worked on project that analyzed how bobwhite quail population is affected by prescribed burning and rotational grazing.   
    - Began developing ranch management plans for a 10,000-acre ranch in southern Oklahoma.
